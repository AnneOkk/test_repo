# Workshop Quarto 

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## *Running Code*

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
7*6
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = NA) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```



```{r}
#| echo: false
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| include: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Running code via terminal
